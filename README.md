# Semester project 2

## About

This website is to serve as a one stop site for tech and info about development.
As of now the text is just fill text from lorem ipsum, but as time goes it can evolve into a fully fledged site.

## Site usecase
This site was made as a semester project for the Frontend studies I did as a student. The focus was put into functionality over form.

## Frontend technology
![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=html,scss,js)

The site is built up on HTML, CSS and JS, and no external JS frameworks was intended for the project.

## Backend technology
![Strapi](https://img.shields.io/badge/strapi-%232E7EEA.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=strapi&logoColor=white)
![Heroku](https://img.shields.io/badge/heroku-%23430098.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=heroku&logoColor=white)

The backend API is built using Strapi Headless CMS v. 3.4 and deployed to Heroku hosting service.
