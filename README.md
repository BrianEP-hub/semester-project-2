# Semester project 2

## About

This website is to serve as a one stop site for tech and info about development.
As of now the text is just fill text from lorem ipsum, but as time goes it can evolve into a fully fledged site.

## Site usecase
This site was made as a semester project for the Frontend studies I did as a student. The focus was put into functionality over form.

## Technology used
HTML 5, SaSS, JavaScript, Strapi.

The site is built up on HTML, CSS and JS, and no external JS frameworks was intended for the project.
The backend API is built using Strapi Headless CMS v. 3.4 and deployed to Heroku hosting service.


### Backend login

## Compile scss
